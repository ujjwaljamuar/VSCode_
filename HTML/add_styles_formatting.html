    <p style="padding: 16px;font-size: 24px; line-height: 1.5;background-color:lightcyan;">The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly
        or indirectly.Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the
        remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
        Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest planet,
        Mercury.<br>
    
        The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular
        cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained
        in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being
        primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive
        than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of
        hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of
        substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as
        water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc
        called the ecliptic.</p>
