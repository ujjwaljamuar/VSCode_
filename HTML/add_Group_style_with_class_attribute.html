            Mercury is the closest planet to our Sun, the smallest of the eight planets, and one of the most extreme
            worlds in our Solar Systems. Named after the Roman messenger of the gods, the planet is one of a handful
            that can be viewed without the aid of a telescope. As such, it has played an active role in the mythological
            and astrological systems of many cultures.

            In spite of that, Mercury is one of the least understood planets in our Solar System. Much like Venus, its
            orbit between Earth and the Sun means that it can be seen at both morning and evening (but never in the
            middle of the night). And like Venus and the Moon, it also goes through phases; a characteristic which
            originally confounded astronomers, but eventually helped them to realize the true nature of the Solar
            System.

            The Blue Marble is an image of Earth taken on December 7, 1972, from a distance of about 29,000 kilometers
            (18,000 miles) from the planet's surface.[1][2][3] It was taken by the crew of the Apollo 17 spacecraft on
            its way to the Moon, and is one of the most reproduced images in history.[4][5][a]

            It mainly shows the Earth from the Mediterranean Sea to Antarctica. This was the first time the Apollo
            trajectory made it possible to photograph the south polar ice cap, despite the Southern Hemisphere being
            heavily covered in clouds. In addition to the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar, almost the entire coastline
            of Africa is clearly visible. The Asian mainland is on the horizon.

            NASA has also applied the name to a 2012 series of images which cover the entire globe at relatively high
            resolution. These were created by looking through satellite pictures taken over time in order to find as
            many cloudless photographs as possible to use in the final images.

            Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
            brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare
            occasion, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[15][16] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never
            appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a
            little while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[17] With a rotation period of 243
            Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System by far, and
            does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the
            east).[18] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the
            Solar System.[19]
